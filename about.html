        <p>
            I recently completed my secondary education with a strong academic performance, achieving A1s in Physics,
            Chemistry, and Further Mathematics, in the WAEC exams. I also scored 352 in JAMB, further solidifying my foundation for pursuing higher education.
            Currently, I am preparing to study <i>Mechatronics Engineering</i> at <i>FUT Minna</i>, where I plan to
            deepen my understanding of engineering principles while applying them to real-world problems. Alongside my
            formal education, I am actively learning web development, focusing on technologies like <i>HTML, CSS,
            JavaScript, React, and MySQL</i>, and constantly building projects to expand my skill set.
